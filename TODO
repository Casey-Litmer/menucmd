TODO


* end_to now has access to results and thus supports Bind.  Does that mean default eval with arg = result[0] is obsolete?
  Does it make sense with excepting None returns in general?
  Does it make sense with escape_to?


 * Update docs on all new stuff


 * Upload newest version using PyTools4Windows





* Added choose_item:: list x tuple x dict x set -> Any

  How to extend edit_list to -> dict x set ?
