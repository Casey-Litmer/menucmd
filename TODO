TODO


* Bind only evaluates direct nestings of itself.   for example:

    B(f, B(g, z), x, y) will evaluate g(z)
but B(f', [B(g,z), x], y) will not!

(both domains of f and f' are isomorphic)
so...
  is this something that needs to be changed for sake of completeness?  or just let it be?




X* address all comments!



x* end_to now has access to results and thus supports Bind.  Does that mean default eval with arg = result[0] is obsolete?
  Does it make sense with excepting None returns in general?
  Does it make sense with escape_to?  exit_to?

  Eh, not really for now.  Might come back to this.


X* Update docs on all new stuff



 X* Upload newest version using PyTools4Windows

     On 'pre-release'



X* Added choose_item:: list x tuple x dict x set -> Any

  How to extend edit_list to -> dict x set ?

  Answer: by using a couple more brain cells and quitting my job.
