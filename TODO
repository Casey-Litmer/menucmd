#Version 1.1.0
#-----------------

* Update to newest macrolibs to fix some bugs

* TRAMPOLINE

* Add Sections hyperlinks in README


X* Create dsl for menu creation

* Document weird things
  X- when menu2.exit_to = menu1, it passes the arg that menu2 is run with.
    Xuse exit_to = Bind(menu1, x) to specify what to run it with

  X- Bind appends args to its own on call so polymorphic functions like print may pick up
    the menu argument:  arg_to = B(print, 'hey') -> print('hey', arg)

    X- add Bind(...).fix() to docs



#------------------

X* Bind only evaluates direct nestings of itself.   for example:

    B(f, B(g, z), x, y) will evaluate g(z)
but B(f', [B(g,z), x], y) will not!

(both domains of f and f' are isomorphic)
so...
  is this something that needs to be changed for sake of completeness?  or just let it be?

    X Added a comment about it.  It doesn't make sense for menucmd, but in future lazy eval programs it might...
      (Consider adding to macrolibs)




x* result.expand() only allows for direct nestings!!!  Extend the scope of this notation-




x* end_to now has access to results and thus supports Bind.  Does that mean default eval with arg = result[0] is obsolete?
  Does it make sense with excepting None returns in general?
  Does it make sense with escape_to?  exit_to?

  Eh, not really for now.  Might come back to this.


X* Update docs on all new stuff



 X* Upload newest version using PyTools4Windows

     On 'pre-release'



X* Added choose_item:: list x tuple x dict x set -> Any

  How to extend edit_list to -> dict x set ?

  Answer: by using a couple more brain cells and quitting my job.
