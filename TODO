#Version 1.1.0
#-----------------

* Update to newest macrolibs to fix some bugs (WIP)

* ~~TRAMPOLINE~~

* Add Sections hyperlinks in README

* LIMITATION: menus cannot be used in functions.  Instead, a function must take the result of a menu inside a chain
  because a menu may return MenuManager.__null__.
  This is a limitation I am ok with, it just needs to be documented.

* ~~Create dsl for menu creation~~

* Document weird things
  - ~~when menu2.exit_to = menu1, it passes the arg that menu2 is run with.~~
  - ~~use exit_to = Bind(menu1, x) to specify what to run it with~~

  - ~~Bind appends args to its own on call so polymorphic functions like print may pick up
    the menu argument:  arg_to = B(print, 'hey') -> print('hey', arg)~~

    - ~~add Bind(...).fix() to docs~~



#------------------

* ~~Bind only evaluates direct nestings of itself.   for example:~~

    ~~B(f, B(g, z), x, y) will evaluate g(z)
but B(f', [B(g,z), x], y) will not!~~

(both domains of f and f' are isomorphic)
so...
  is this something that needs to be changed for sake of completeness?  or just let it be

Added a comment about it.  It doesn't make sense for menucmd, but in future lazy eval programs it might...
(Consider adding to macrolibs)



* ~~result.expand() only allows for direct nestings!!!  Extend the scope of this notation-~~




* ~~end_to now has access to results and thus supports Bind.  Does that mean default eval with arg = result[0] is obsolete?
  Does it make sense with excepting None returns in general?
  Does it make sense with escape_to?  exit_to?~~

  Eh, not really for now.  Might come back to this.


* ~~Update docs on all new stuff~~



 * ~~Upload newest version using PyTools4Windows~~

     On 'pre-release'



* ~~Added choose_item:: list x tuple x dict x set -> Any~~

  How to extend edit_list to -> dict x set ?

  Answer: by using a couple more brain cells and quitting my job.
